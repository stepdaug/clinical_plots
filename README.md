https://stepdaug-clinical-plots-streamlit-plot-h5drxe.streamlit.app/

A simple Streamlit tool to summarise clinical data. Often useful for ID/inflammatory issues. It plots medication dates, steroid doses/dates, lab results (e.g. CRP), temperature and can add annotations with freetext of pertinent events. No data is stored at any point, it simply generates a plot.

data_sample.xlsx = example of the specific format data needs to be in
streamlit_plot.py = code to generate the streamlit page
python_plot.py = code for the exact same functionality but to run on your local machine with python
